If you navigate to the Earthquake_Challenge folder and open the index.html file, it will navigate you to a site that charts out earthquake data taken from the United States Geological Survey agency. It is charted using 3 visual maps ("Streets", "Satellite" and "Dark")  and also contains additional overlays of tectonic plate data and one where it highlights earthquakes that are over 4.5 on the seismic scale; scaled from light gray (4.5), dark gray(5) to black (6+).
